# Agenda
- So I basically added my own header to each page and am trying to make the styling of your friends website different
- If you guys can work on the pages I assigned that would be great, you can basically use the same html and js from ur friend but make sure to add things that you would want in as well
- Also make sure that the css is significantly different you can just play around with the settings from you friends
